					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>Based out of China, Meitu isn’t exactly a household name in many parts of the world. Even so, the company has made a huge splash by unveiling the selfie lover’s dream smartphone, the Meitu V4, reports PhoneArena.</p>

					<p>EEven though the phone is plenty powerful, with its octa-core MediaTek MT6795 processor and 3GB of RAM, the V4’s claim to fame is the whopping 21-megapixel front-facing camera. With that level of resolution, this camera could easily put to shame those found on so-called “selfie smartphones,” such as the HTC Desire Eye and the Sony Xperia C3. Of course, megapixels don’t tell the whole story, but they do at least help paint a picture of what the V4’s front camera sensor can accomplish.</p>

					<p>You’ll also find a 21-megapixel camera on the back, as well as a 5-inch, 1,920 x 1,080 resolution AMOLED display. Taking a peek further underneath the hood reveals 64GB of internal memory, though it’s not clear whether this is expandable through a Micro SD card slot.</p>
